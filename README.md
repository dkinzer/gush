Gush an OpenShift Drupal Profile
================================

This repo is a fork of the [OpenShift Drupal Quick-Start](https://github.com/openshift/drupal-quickstart) project. Except, that it acts like a regular Drupal Profile as well.

I am using this project to demonstrate how to configure an Drupal OpenShift project to use Travis-CI in a Continuous Integration workflow.
