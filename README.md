Gush an OpenShift Drupal Profile [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/gush.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/gush)
================================

This repo is a fork of the [OpenShift Drupal Quick-Start](https://github.com/openshift/drupal-quickstart) project. Except, that it acts like a regular Drupal Profile as well.

I am using this project to demonstrate how to configure a Drupal OpenShift project to use Travis-CI in a Continuous Integration workflow. 

Essentially what I show here is a set up with the following workflow:

Dev >> GitHub >> Travis >> OpenShift (Deployed)

I've published the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/dkinzer/setting-up-a-travis-continuous-integration-environment-for-your-drupal-module) for the talk I gave at Drupadelphia to Speaker Deck.
