Gush an OpenShift Drupal Profile [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/gush.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dkinzer/gush)
================================

This repo is a fork of the [OpenShift Drupal Quick-Start](https://github.com/openshift/drupal-quickstart) project. Except, that it acts like a regular Drupal Profile as well.

I am using this project to demonstrate how to configure an Drupal OpenShift project to use Travis-CI in a Continuous Integration workflow.
